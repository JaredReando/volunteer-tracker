# Volunteer Tracker

#### _Database app for tracking projects and volunteers._

#### By _**Jared Reando**_

## Description

Easily keep track of multiple projects and volunteers using this delightfully simple web application. It really does it all:

  - Create projects
  - Edit project names
  - Add volunteers to existing projects
  - Edit volunteer names
  - Delete volunteers and projects for various reasons:
    - Project completed
    - Cancellations
    - Crippling shame/failure
